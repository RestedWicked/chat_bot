 # Seriously I spent too much time figuring out, how to animate with python, then I had to use a multithreading function, just so the animation could play, while also waiting for a keypress to continue, This secretly added a challenge, because I spent hours looking into why my global variables weren't working and thats cuz they work different when you have a nested function, so then it was too late, but i discovered nonLocal variables, didn't help that when i looked up Global Variables, it kept telling me to go to spherical variables, but that didn't work here anyway. You can excuse that I didn't spent too much time on the writing.

# Don't get me wrong
